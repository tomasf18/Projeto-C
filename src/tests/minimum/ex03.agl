#(
    This example illustrates the instantiation of a view, a rectangle and a pie slice
    to create a Pacman in a simple time-driven animation.
#)

#
# create an instance of a View.
#
view : View with {
    width = 401;
    height = 401;
    title = "Illustrating the rectangle shape";
    background = "wheat";
}

#
# create an instance of a rectangle
#
Rectangle at (10,0) with {
    length = (200,60);
    fill = "blue";
}

#
# create an instance of a pie slice, storing its reference
#
pacman : PieSlice at (0,0) with {
    length = (50,50);
    fill = "pink";
    start = 30;
    extent = 300;
}

#
# The refresh view command makes the graphics appear
#
refresh view;

#
# iteration to make the pacman open and close its mouth and to move 
# both the pacman and the view to the right, such that pacman keeps
# in the center of the view
#
for i in 1..10 do {
    with pacman do {
        start = 1;
        extent = 359;

        extent = 300;
    }
    refresh view after 200 ms;
    move pacman by (10,0);    # the 'by' makes the movement relative; the argument is a vector
    move view by (10,0);    # the 'by' makes the movement relative; the argument is a vector
    refresh view;
